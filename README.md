# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this project is to assist Pewlett-Hackard in creating a database system that stores all of the important personal information for each of their employees. This will help the company better understand their employees, and help get over the “silver tsunami” through data-based decisions as many current employees reach retirement age. The neccesaary tools for this project include PostgreSQL and pgAdmin, and they are where all our SQL actions will take place. While Postgres holds the files, pgAdmin provides the access. Prior the creation process, we will map out each table in the database and the flow of data from one table to another. Once a functional database is set up, Bobby wants us to write some queries to provide the number of retiring employees per title, and identify any employyes who are eligible for thier mentorship program.
